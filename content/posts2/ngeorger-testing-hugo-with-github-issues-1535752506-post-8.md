Using GitHub CLI in workflows
You can script with GitHub CLI in GitHub Actions workflows.

To learn more about GitHub CLI, see "[About GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli)."

GitHub CLI is preinstalled on all GitHub-hosted runners. For each step that uses GitHub CLI, you must set an environment variable called GITHUB_TOKEN to a token with the required scopes.

You can execute any GitHub CLI command. For example, this workflow uses the gh issue comment subcommand to add a comment when an issue is opened.
